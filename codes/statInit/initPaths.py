Without discipline, your thoughts are not your own - they can scarcely be said to inhabit your brain. Your passions travel invisible planes.

People believe the dead must cross into some great below or heaven above when their bodies fall, the puppet\'s strings cut; but Moros reach across the gulf and speak to the dead, or correct a malfunctioning demise where part of the soul stays behind.

To an Obrimos, magic is the academic discipline that studies these laws or an act of faith that appeals to the God that made them. Call them Thaumaturges, Greek for "wonder-workers," because they follow in the footsteps of Hermes Trismegistus, read the Emerald Tablet, and sing Thoth\'s hymn. Label them Theurgists when they call magic the hidden hand of the Creator, and appeal to Heaven\'s aristocracy in Her name. If you broke into their sancta you might find the stereotypical marks of wizardry: robes, circles of salt, and the rest. Magic has a structure, and it\'s often easier to express it through traditional tools than hold it all in the imago. Others approach magic as a science and engineering feat. They prefer labs and workshops to walls carved with the names of God.'

The last part breaks his life\'s symmetry. He\'s from a world of flesh, not ephemera, and that\'s where his final loyalties lie. Nevertheless, he sees the shared pulse of mortal and ephemeral life. He sings its music. He could even get lost in it to be reborn an Ecstatic, a living example of simple, forgotten truths. Followers of the Path often tread between these extremes along the living axis mundi that binds diverse realms and states of being.'
