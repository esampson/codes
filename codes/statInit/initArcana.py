This tends to make practitioners seem morbid, though few are. Mages who delve into the mysteries of Death find solace and understanding in the fact that all things come to an end. While such thoughts may look fatalistic on the surface, a mage who sees past the Lie realizes she has the power to not only create these states, but to control, manipulate, and even prevent them. She can bolster a soul, restore pleasure to a ghost, and reverse the effects of aging just as well as she can destroy souls, rip ghosts from anchors, and steal the life from another.'

With it a mage can alter and control light, sound, fire, and electricity - even gravity, radiation, and weather patterns. Forces is rarely subtle, but clever wizards find ways to use it so: hearing a sound from across a room, deadening the noise spellcasting makes, or seeing great distances. Skilled practitioners of Forces can also unleash tornadoes, earthquakes, and devastating blasts of fire when subtlety gives way to quick anger.'

Things which were once alive but are no longer, as well as substances derived from life but which are not themselves alive, are also governed by this Arcanum. A Matter spell can rot and warp the boards of a wooden house, or turn a glass of water into wine. Matter is seen as the most base of the Arcana by many mages, closest to the profane Lie, but the Stygian Masters know that the crude Matter of the Fallen World is but an echo of the perfected material of the Supernal.'

Initiates of the Mind tend to explore social interactions and the core concepts that make up language, communication, and shared experiences. Those who explore its depths further find themselves embroiled in a dichotomy of introspection and social extroversion centered on the need to examine all aspects of the mind\'s capacity for emotion, thought, and aspirations. Other mages tend to enjoy the Mind mage\'s company insofar as she retains her grounding. Many an unwary mage has found himself pulled into conversations far too cerebral and esoteric for his liking without even knowing how he ended up there.'

Through Prime, a mage becomes attuned to the Supernal Truth, capable of piercing illusions and calling forth perfected images of the symbol-beings of the Aether. Arrogant Obrimos sometimes claim that this makes Prime the greatest of the Arcana, but that is an oversimplification.
