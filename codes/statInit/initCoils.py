Initiates of the Mystery believe that by overcoming the banes of fire and sunlight a Dragon can in turn defeat her every infirmity. This is not to be mistaken with a return to mortality. Such a change would be seen as an exchange of weaknesses, rather than true transcendence, and would be likely to get a vampire laughed at and his research ignored.'
