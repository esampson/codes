Many of the lodge members are practitioners of free-running, enabling them to leap from building to building with ease.'

The Lodge of the Einherjar, based in northern Colorado, devotes itself to uncovering the stories of these "lost packs" and sharing them with the Forsaken at large.

The lodge finds local legends and folklore, stories of murderous ghosts and psycho killers, and tweaks the stories to its own ends. With Gifts, rumor-mongering, and the occasional gruesome kill, lodge members add useful details to the legends: Old Bill can’t smell you if you hide in the boughs of a pine tree. The Coulee Ridge Cannibal won’t go back to the cabin where he ate his whole family. That sort of thing.'
