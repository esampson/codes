Casting a rite is a fervent, consuming, ecstatic experience, and Acolytes often push the edge of frenzy when they perform their sorcery.

The cavern walls were covered in inscribed incantations and diagrams. These formed the basis of Theban Sorcery, which Daniel faithfully recorded and passed on to his fellow Kindred. Theban Sorcery is stern, deliberate, and judgmental - the product of a harsh, uncompromising faith - and the power it calls down feels the same way. Some ritualists characterize the power of miracles as transmitting the touch of God\'s Curse (as opposed to the Beast) onto the subject. Sanctified miracles provide divinations, reveal wrong-doers and punish those who trespass against the church\'s laws. Performing a Theban miracle is an act of concentrated faith, mentally exhausting and not done in haste. Every miracle requires a physical sacrament, a symbolic item that crumbles to dust as though it were a slain elder when the ritual reaches a crescendo.'
